1. In the crash of a fighter jet, an object travelling approximately 700 miles
per hour (~350 meters per second) is brought to rest in about 1.5 seconds.
What acceleration is required to stop the jet's motion ?  What could you
compare this number to to get a sense of the size of this acceleration?  Could the pilot survive?

2. Compute the derivative of the following functions with respect to time:

   a.  $x(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 10 $
   b.  $x(t) = 11t^3 - 5t^2 + 6t - 2$

3. In number (2), if $x(t)$ represents the position of an object, what does the derivative represent?
