1. If $100 kg$ was the most you could bench press, with what speed could you
*throw* $50 kg$ from the bench position?  Explain your reasoning and any
assumptions you make in complete sentences.

2. Compute the integral  and derivative of each of the following functions with respect to time:

   a.  $v(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 10 $
   b.  $v(t) = 11t^3 - 5t^2 + 6t - 2$

3. In number (2), if $v(t)$ represents the velocity of an object, what does the
derivative represent?  What does the integral represent?
