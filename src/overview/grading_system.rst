General Physics I
=================



J. Ives: 

 1. smartphysics pre-class assignments (watch multimedia with embedded multiple choice, then give explanations.  Points are for the explanations)
 2. smartphysics online homework (interactive examples and end-of-chapter style.  Students do a lot of number mashing, but they like it)
 3. group quizzes (one per week. do individually for 75% of grade, then in groups with if-at for 25%)
 4. quiz corrections (diagnose and treat their errors.  earn half credit back)
 5. in-class clickers and whiteboards
