COURSE DESCRIPTION
================== 

SCI2012L is an introductory calculus based Physics Laboratory class
that meets 3 hours per week. It is an inquiry based laboratory course
coordinated with SCI2012 Physics II.  Small teams of students work
together to solve practical Newtonian physics problems by conducting a
sequence of observations and tests.  Students are responsible for
developing their own experiments and task assignments as they work
within collaborative team structures, using the collected data to
construct original models of physical phenomena.  Students practice
skills employed by professional engineers and scientists.  The
laboratory exercises reinforce theories discussed in class, including
error analysis, heat transfer, electric and magnetic fields, circuits,
digital instruments, and optics.


COURSE OBJECTIVES
===================

Upon satisfactory completion of this course, a student should have the ability to:

1. Apply the scientific method of inquiry during all laboratory activities
2. Construct proper, organized and supervised experiments in search of solutions to directed laboratory research questions that originate from an original hypothesis.
3. Choose the most appropriate physics conceptual frameworks to guide their decisions in planning the use of laboratory equipment required to explore the student’s hypothesis.
4. Analyze resulting data to propose logical conclusions.
5. Evaluate their findings with predicted outcomes to appraise their hypothesis.
6. Apply oral communications in cooperative learning teams and written communication skills recorded in laboratory notebooks and laboratory reports.
7. Analyze and evaluate prior research of laboratory subject matter to gain an informed perspective on laboratory experiments.
8. Students will synthesize main ideas to construct new concepts by

   a. Recognizing interrelationships among concepts and combining them into potentially useful primary statements with supporting evidence. 
   b. Extending initial synthesis, when possible, at a higher level of abstraction to construct new hypothesis that may require additional information.
