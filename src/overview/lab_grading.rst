Grades in the lab portion of this class will be assigned based on a weighted
average of your performance in these categories:

* 10%	Final Exam
* 20%	Pre-lab assignments
* 30%	Lab write-ups	
* 10%	Project Proposal
* 20%	Project Presentation
* 10%   Participation


The lab will run every week on the assigned day for 3 hours.  You should plan to be present for the entire three hours.  

Each week a pre-lab assignment will be given to help you prepare for the lab.  This should be completed and turned in *at the beginning* of the lab period.  

Each week you will construct an experiment related to the course material from the lecture, using materials and equipment in the lab.  In many cases, you will be devising an experiment of your own, to test different models of physical phenomena.  You will prepare a write-up describing  your experiment and your conclusions, justifying those conclusions based on the data you gathered.  These will be due on Sunday night following a given lab, and should be typed and submitted online through ulearn.  

At the midpoint of the course, you will submit a proposal for a larger experiment.

Your participation grade will include your contributions to the class and to
your groups during class time.  You will prepare a short assignment at the end
of the term describing your specific contributions to the class and your group,
and justifying a letter grade that you will propose.  (You will suggest a grade
in the range A-F, and explain why it is the grade you deserve).
