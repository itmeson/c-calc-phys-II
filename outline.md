COURSE DESCRIPTION
================== 

SCI2012 is the second of a two
part introductory Physics course sequence using calculus-based
mathematical approaches to analyze physics phenomena.  It introduces
students to heat, wave propagation, wave energy, reflection,
refraction, electricity, magnetism, circuits, and semiconductors.
SCI2012 must be taken concurrently with the laboratory section (see
SCI2012L, Physics II Laboratory).

COURSE OBJECTIVES
=================

Based on materials presented in class, on readings, and assigned audiovisual materials, students will be able to:

 1. Apply and discuss the principles of heat transfer, waves, electricity, magnetism, and the polarization of light to explain the behavior of charges and currents. 
 2. Analyze heat transfer, electricity, magnetism, and light concepts by using calculus-based approaches to solve problems and evaluate solutions.
 3. Correctly describe, predict, and calculate the magnetic forces on moving charges and current-carrying wires, and determine the magnitude and direction of induced electrical fields for given changes in magnetic flux.
 4. Analyze the characteristics of heat transfer, electrostatics and electro-magnetic waves to construct potential alternative theories that explain those phenomena. 
 5. Integrate qualitative reasoning, pictorial and graphical reasoning, and reasoning by analogy to distinguish physics related patterns and relationships that exist in nature.
 6. Perform an analysis of the properties of conductors, resisters, capacitors, and semi conductors to determine electrostatic potential and discuss the physical parameters governing electrical resistance.
 7. Students will synthesize main ideas to construct new concepts by
    a. Recognizing interrelationships among concepts and combining them into potentially useful primary statements with supportive evidence.
    b. Extending initial synthesis, when possible, at a higher level of abstraction to construct new hypotheses that may require additional information.
 8. Students will recognize the use of deductive reasoning to examine and test scientific   hypotheses.

EVALUATIVE CRITERIA:	
1. Final grades will be based on at least four graded items one of which will be an examination administered at the official scheduled final exam time.
2. A portion of the class grade may be assigned on the basis of class participation and timeliness of performance.
3. A fraction of the grade will be based upon completion of homework problem solving exercises selected by the instructor.
4. A percentage of the class grade will be based on written student centered activities focused on investigating particular Physics principles in more depth.

Weighted percentages of these criteria will be determined by the professor at the beginning of class.

LABORATORY:  Students must be concurrently registered in SCI2012L, SCI2012 PHYSICS LAB (w/ CALCULUS) (see separate course outline).
